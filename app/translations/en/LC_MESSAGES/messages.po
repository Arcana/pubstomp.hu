"from the city centre, but it still shouldn't take longer than around 30 "
"minutes to get there. The bus line 103 drops you off right at the place, "
"which in turn is connected to metro line M2 at the Puskás Ferenc Stadion "
"metro station. If you don't mind a 15 minute walk, you can also get off of "
"metro line M3 at Nagyvárad tér, and continue your trip on foot."
